  <p>Dylan DiMaggio was born in sunny Tucson, Arizona. Years of living in the desert left him with a dry sense of humor, and a thirst for creative adventures. He moved to Los Angeles where he pursued a career in screenwriting. He currently resides back in Arizona with his lovely wife and wonderful children. He is also writing this bio, and feels weird about referring to himself in the third person.</p>
